# Sarcasm-Detection

Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony that is intended to express contempt or ridicule, requiring wit to understand and wit to produce and relying on the shared knowledge between the speaker and his audience. In its verbal use, the audience can use gestures, mimics and prosody to hint the sarcastic intent. Since we do not have access to such paralinguistic cues, detecting sarcasm in written text is a hard task. 

Ten years ago, researchers tried to see it through cues such as interjections, intensifiers, punctuation, hyperbole, etc (i.e through various combinations of lexical, semantic, pragmatic and sentiment features). Recently, deep neural networks have received more attention in the sarcasm detection field. 

I am investigating various methods to detect sarcasm in tweets by using both traditional and deep learning approaches. My future aspirations related to this project are to obtain a state-of-the-art model capable of understanding the human usage of sarcasm in written text and, potentially, distinguishing between sarcasm and irony, which are both similar, but very complex forms of sentiment-bearing expressions that humans frequently use in their daily interactions.

The Twitter dataset belongs to researchers Aniruddha Ghosh and Tony Veale and can be obtained from their GitHub repository https://github.com/AniSkywalker/SarcasmDetection and is under free licence utilisation.

This research project is completed in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, at the University of Manchester and under the supervision of professor John Mcnaught.
